cargo-check-external-types
==========================

`cargo-check-external-types` is a static analysis tool for Rust library authors
to set and verify which types from other libraries are allowed to be exposed in
their public API. This is useful for ensuring that a breaking change to a
dependency doesn't force a breaking change in the library that's using it.

The tool has two output formats to cover different use-cases:

- `errors` (the default): Output error messages for each type that is exposed in
  the public API and exit with status 1 if there is at least one error. This is
  useful for continuous integration.
- `markdown-table`: Output the places types are exposed as a Markdown table.
  This is intended as a discovery tool for established projects.

The tool has an optional configuration file where types can by explicitly
allowed.

Example Output
--------------

The test suite has a Rust library that [relies on some external
types](test-workspace/test-crate/src/lib.rs). When the tool is run against this
library without any configuration, [it emits
errors](tests/default-config-expected-output.md) for each occurrence of an
external type in the public API.

When [a config file](tests/allow-some-types.toml) is provided, the allowed
external types [no longer show up in the
output](tests/allow-some-types-expected-output.md).

When the output format is set to `markdown-table`, then a [table of external
types](tests/output-format-markdown-table-expected-output.md) is output.

How to Use
----------

_Important:_ This tool requires a nightly build of Rust to be installed since it
relies on the [rustdoc JSON
output](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/76578), which hasn't been
stabilized yet. The `main` branch was last tested against `nightly-2024-10-29`.
For info on what nightly version a specific release depends on, see the
[releases](https://github.com/awslabs/cargo-check-external-types/releases) page.

To install, run the following from this README path:

```bash
cargo install --locked cargo-check-external-types
```

Then, in your library crate path, run:
```bash
cargo +nightly check-external-types
```

This will produce errors if any external types are used in a public API at all.
That's not terribly useful on its own, so the tool can be given configuration in
your crate's `Cargo.toml` to allow certain types. For example, we can allow any
type in `bytes` by adding this metadata to your crate's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package.metadata.cargo_check_external_types]
allowed_external_types = ["bytes::*"]
```

Or, if you'd prefer, you can create a separate configuration file with the content:

```toml
allowed_external_types = [
    "bytes::*",
]
```

Save that file somewhere in your project (in this example, we choose the name
`external-types.toml`), and then run the command with:

```bash
cargo +nightly check-external-types --config external-types.toml
```

If both a `Cargo.toml` package metadata section and a `--config` flag are
provided, the `--config` flag will be used instead of the package metadata.

### Caveats

When public types and modules declared inside a `#[doc(hidden)]` module are
reexported from a public module, they aren't checked for external types. This is
because of how they are recorded in RustDoc's index. When such types and modules
are encountered by this tool, a warning will be logged.

## Updating `rustdoc-types` and the Rust toolchain version

`rustdoc-types` defines an unstable JSON format that this tool is based on. When
updating `rustdoc-types`, the Rust toolchain version must be updated to a
nightly version that supports the version of the JSON format being used.

It's usually enough to update the toolchain to whatever the most recent nightly
version is. All in all, you must update:

- The `rustdoc-types` dependency in `Cargo.toml` to the new version.
- The `rust-toolchain` file to point to the new nightly version.
- The `README.md` file, specifically the *"It was last tested against `nightly-XXXX-XX-XX`."* of the ["How to Use"](#how-to-use) section.
- The `rust_version` in the [CI workflow file](.github/workflows/ci.yml). 

Then, PR your changes.
